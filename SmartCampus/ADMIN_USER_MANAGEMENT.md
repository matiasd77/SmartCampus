# Admin User Management Guide

## Overview

This document outlines how administrators can create and manage professor and admin accounts in the SmartCampus system. Public registration is restricted to students only for security reasons.

## üîí **Security Policy**

### Public Registration Restrictions
- ‚úÖ **Students**: Can register through the public `/api/auth/register` endpoint
- ‚ùå **Professors**: Must be created by administrators
- ‚ùå **Administrators**: Must be created by existing administrators

### Rationale
- **Security**: Prevents unauthorized access to administrative functions
- **Control**: Ensures only qualified individuals receive elevated privileges
- **Audit Trail**: All non-student accounts are created through controlled processes

## üë®‚Äçüíº **Creating Professor Accounts**

### Method 1: Direct Database Insert (Development)
```sql
INSERT INTO users (name, email, password, role, is_active, created_at, updated_at)
VALUES (
    'Dr. Jane Smith',
    'jane.smith@university.edu',
    '$2a$10$encoded_password_hash', -- Use BCrypt encoder
    'PROFESSOR',
    true,
    NOW(),
    NOW()
);
```

### Method 2: Admin API Endpoint (Recommended)
```bash
POST /api/admin/users
Authorization: Bearer <admin-jwt-token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Dr. Jane Smith",
  "email": "jane.smith@university.edu",
  "password": "SecurePassword123!",
  "role": "PROFESSOR"
}
```

### Method 3: Admin Interface (Future Implementation)
- Access admin dashboard at `/admin`
- Navigate to "User Management"
- Click "Create Professor Account"
- Fill in required details
- Submit for approval

## üîß **Creating Administrator Accounts**

### Method 1: Direct Database Insert (Development)
```sql
INSERT INTO users (name, email, password, role, is_active, created_at, updated_at)
VALUES (
    'Admin User',
    'admin@university.edu',
    '$2a$10$encoded_password_hash', -- Use BCrypt encoder
    'ADMIN',
    true,
    NOW(),
    NOW()
);
```

### Method 2: Admin API Endpoint (Recommended)
```bash
POST /api/admin/users
Authorization: Bearer <admin-jwt-token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Admin User",
  "email": "admin@university.edu",
  "password": "SecurePassword123!",
  "role": "ADMIN"
}
```

## üõ† **Implementation Details**

### Backend Validation
The registration endpoint includes validation to prevent non-STUDENT roles:

```java
@Override
public User register(RegisterRequest request) {
    // Ensure only STUDENT role is allowed for public registration
    Role userRole = request.getRole();
    if (userRole == null) {
        userRole = Role.STUDENT; // Default to STUDENT if no role provided
    } else if (userRole != Role.STUDENT) {
        throw new RuntimeException("Only STUDENT role is allowed for public registration. " +
                                 "Professors and Admins must be created by administrators.");
    }
    
    // ... rest of registration logic
}
```

### Frontend Restrictions
The registration form automatically assigns STUDENT role:

```typescript
const requestBody = {
  name: data.name.trim(),
  email: data.email.trim().toLowerCase(),
  password: data.password,
  role: 'STUDENT' as const // Automatically assign STUDENT role
};
```
